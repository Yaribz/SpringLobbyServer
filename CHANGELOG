SpringLobbyServer.pm:
====================
0.11: first public version
0.12: add "onMotd" callback to allow customizing the MOTD dynamically
      change %DEFAULT_PARAMS and %DEFAULT_PARAMS_LAN_MODE lexical variables to package variables
0.13: add support for "battleStatus:teams-8bit" lobby protocol extension (disabled by default)
      allow enabling/disabling custom lobby protocol extensions in constructor
0.14: use REGEX_AIBOTNAME to check AI bot names format instead of REGEX_USERNAME (fix Chobby clients being kicked when adding AI bot)
      reject chat commands with empty message
      do not send empty SETSCRIPTTAGS command to users joining a battle containing no script tag
      new log/debug parameters to filter log writing by domain
0.15: fix "JOIN" command password parameter not checked and not passed to the "onChannelJoin" callback
      use DEFAULT_CLIENTSTATUS, DEFAULT_CLIENTBATTLESTATUS and DEFAULT_TEAMCOLOR constants from SpringLobbyProtocol module insted of hardcoded values
      rename "aiDll" field to "aiName"
0.16: add support for "redirect" mode
0.17: always send client battle status response to command originator for MYBATTLESTATUS, UPDATEBOT, FORCETEAMNO and FORCEALLYNO commands (even if command has no effect)
      do not send response to battle founders using TASClient for DISABLEUNIT, ENABLEUNITS, ENABLEALLUNITS, ADDSTARTRECT and REMOVESTARTRECT commands (behavior of legacy lobby server)
      auto send REMOVESTARTRECT command before ADDSTARTRECT command to clients using TASClient when an existing start area is replaced
      send lobby protocol extensions message to all clients except TASClient, Chobby, SpringLobby and Skylobby (was only sent to SPADS previously)
      send start areas data just after disabled units list upon battle lobby join (i.e. before the list of client battle status)
      improve code style for some broadcast functions (broadcastChannelLegacy, broadcastBattle, broadcastBattleUFlag)
      fix case of a handler name
0.18: add support for lobby clients that do not use the 'b' compatibility flag (fix battles opened with SpringLobby clients not being joinable by anyone)
0.19: add "lobbyClientType" field in userInfo structure to ease implementation of lobby client specific behaviors
      fix friend management functionality for skylobby users (skylobby only expects the "userName" field in friend management commands parameters)
      minor rewording of some messages when accountId feature is not implemented
0.20: make usernames case-insensitive
      prevent registering an account while a login attempt is in progress from same connection (race condition)
      fix client not being auto-disconnected after rename operation if it reconnected using old name while rename operation was in progress (race condition)
      increase default thresholds for maximum rate of commands triggering DB accesses
      increase default message size limits in LAN mode (maxReadQueue and maxChatMsgLength)
      new module export tags ("ipAddr", "srvMode", "lobbyClients", "usrRelTypes" and "usrRelListFilters")
      add support for Teiserver specific user relationships management (specific commands + additional relationships: follow/avoid/block), declared as "userRelationships" lobby protocol extension
      replace both "ignoreSvc" and "friendSvc" services by generic "userRelationshipSvc" service (also used for Teiserver specific user relationships)
      use JSON::XS module if available instead of JSON::PP because JSON encoding is now used to generate response for some commands ("c.user.list_relationships", "c.user.whois" and "c.user.whoisName")
      add support for Teiserver specific command "c.battle.update_lobby_title", declared as "updateBattleTitle" lobby protocol extension
